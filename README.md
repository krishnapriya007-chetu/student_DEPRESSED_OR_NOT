# Student Depression Detection

This project uses machine learning to classify whether a student is likely to be depressed based on features like social behavior, academic performance, screen time, and emotional well-being.

---

##  Goal

To build a predictive model that helps identify signs of depression in students early — using survey data and behavioral patterns.

---

## What This Project Covers

- Preprocessing real-world student mental health data  
- Handling missing values and encoding categories  
- Training models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
- Evaluating performance with accuracy, ROC-AUC, and classification report  
- Visualizing results with ROC curves

---

## Libraries Used

- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- xgboost

---

- Source: [UCI / Kaggle Mental Health Datasets]  
- Includes features like:
  - Sleep quality  
  - Screen time  
  - Study hours  
  - Social interactions  
  - Emotional stability

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open the notebook (`student_DEPRESSED_OR_NOT.ipynb`)  
3. Run each cell in order  
4. Check evaluation metrics and ROC-AUC plots
